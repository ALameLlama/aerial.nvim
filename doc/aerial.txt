COMMANDS                                                        *aerial-commands*

                                                                  *:AerialToggle*
:AerialToggle[!] [direction]
        Open or close the aerial window. [direction] can be `left`,
        `right`, or `float`. If without [!] the cursor will jump to the aerial
        window if it was opened.

                                                                    *:AerialOpen*
:AerialOpen[!] [direction]
        Open the aerial window. [direction] can be either `left`, `right`, or
        `float`. If without [!] the cursor will jump to the aerial window.

                                                                   *:AerialClose*
:AerialClose
        Close the aerial window.

                                                                    *:AerialInfo*
:AerialInfo
        Print out debug info related to aerial.

                                                                    *:AerialNext*
:[count]AerialNext
        Jump forwards [count] symbols (default 1).

                                                                    *:AerialPrev*
:[count]AerialPrev
        Jump backwards [count] symbols (default 1).

                                                                  *:AerialNextUp*
:[count]AerialNextUp
        Jump up the tree [count] levels, moving forwards in the file
        (default 1).

                                                                  *:AerialPrevUp*
:[count]AerialPrevUp
        Jump up the tree [count] levels, moving backwards in the file
        (default 1).

                                                                      *:AerialGo*
:[count]AerialGo[!] [split]
        Jump to the [count] symbol (default 1). If with [!] and inside aerial
        window, the cursor will stay in the aerial window. [split] can be "v"
        to open a new vertical split, or "h" to open a horizontal split.
        [split] can also be a raw vim command, such as "belowright split".
        This command respects |switchbuf|=uselast

                                                                *:AerialTreeOpen*
:AerialTreeOpen[!]
        Expand the tree at the current location. If with [!] then will expand
        recursively.

:AerialTreeClose
        Collapse the tree at the current location. If with [!] then will
        collapse recursively.

:AerialTreeOpenAll
        Expand all the tree nodes.

                                                            *:AerialTreeCloseAll*
:AerialTreeCloseAll
        Collapse all the tree nodes.

                                                           *:AerialTreeSyncFolds*

Certain options can be configured per-filetype by passing in a table. "_" will
be used as the default if the filetype is not present. >

        backends = {
            '_'      = {"lsp", "treesitter"},
            'python' = {"treesitter"},

                                                                  *aerial-filter*
If you don't see any symbols in aerial when you expect to, it could be that
the symbol kinds are being filtered out. Aerial only shows a subset of symbols
by default, to avoid clutter. See the "filter_kind" option in |aerial-options|
for details, and try setting "filter_kind = false" to disable all symbol
filtering.

                                                          *aerial-open-automatic*
Aerial can be configured to open automatically in certain conditions. To
replicate the old behavior you could get with `open_automatic_min_lines` and
`open_automatic_min_symbols`, use the following:
>
        local aerial = require("aerial")
        aerial.setup({
          open_automatic = function(bufnr)
            -- Enforce a minimum line count
            return vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(bufnr) > 80
              -- Enforce a minimum symbol count
              and aerial.num_symbols(bufnr) > 4
              -- A useful way to keep aerial closed when closed manually
              and not aerial.was_closed()
        }
